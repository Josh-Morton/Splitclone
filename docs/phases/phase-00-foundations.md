*(Part of the [Tally roadmap](../ROADMAP.md).)*

# Phase 0 — Foundations

- [x] Git repo initialized; project structure (`settleup/` app, `docs/`, `supabase/`)
- [x] Next.js (App Router, TS) scaffold with PWA manifest, icons, service worker
- [x] Design tokens in `globals.css` from the design handoff
- [x] Domain maths ported + 41 unit tests passing (splits, balances, simplify, money, auto-category)
- [x] Repo data-layer interface + in-memory demo implementation (ADR-0005)
- [x] Phase-1 schema migration + RLS written (`supabase/migrations/20260702000000_phase1_schema.sql`)
- [x] Keep-alive cron route (`/api/keepalive` + `vercel.json`)
- [x] ADRs 0001–0008 recorded
- [x] Supabase project created + migration applied via Management API (2026-07-09;
      port 5432 is blocked on this network — use the Management API `database/query`
      endpoint or the SQL editor, not `supabase db push`)
- [x] `.env.local` configured with anon key; REST + RLS connectivity verified
- [x] GitHub repo pushed: https://github.com/Josh-Morton/Splitclone
- [x] Vercel live: **https://splitclone-joshprojects13.vercel.app** (2026-07-10).
      Root Directory + framework set via API (token in macOS keychain, service
      "Vercel Token (SettleUp)", expires ~2026-10; project
      `prj_Pn9YOGxi6sgUcACgUU2glH0mBu02`, team `team_YTsxApEip0v1AllLCINb5CYy`).
      Env vars were already set by Josh. Pushes to main auto-deploy.
- [x] Supabase Auth `site_url` set to the Vercel URL; `*.vercel.app` +
      localhost in the redirect allow list
- [ ] **Manual (Josh, optional):** custom SMTP (e.g. free Resend) so OTP emails
      contain a real 6-digit code — free tier can't edit templates on the default
      sender; magic-link sign-in works meanwhile. *(Decision now tracked inside
      Phase 6 → "Invite / joining flow comms rework".)*
- [x] PWA installs to a phone home screen from the deployed URL (Josh, 2026-07-13)
